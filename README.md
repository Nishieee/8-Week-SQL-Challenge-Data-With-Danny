# 8 Week SQL Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), where I will be solving a series of SQL-based case studies to enhance my SQL querying skills and demonstrate my data analysis capabilities.

## About the Challenge

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is a series of SQL case studies designed to test and build skills in database management, querying, and data analysis. Each case study presents a unique dataset and problem statement, requiring in-depth SQL knowledge to extract insights and solve business problems.

## Case Studies

This repository contains solutions for the following case studies:

1. **Case Study #1: Dannyâ€™s Diner**
   - Analyzing customer spending habits and loyalty program participation at a fictional diner.
   - Key SQL concepts: Joins, Aggregate Functions, Window Functions.
   
2. **Case Study #2: Pizza Runner**
   - Insights into a pizza delivery company's operations by analyzing orders, deliveries, and customer feedback.
   - Key SQL concepts: CTEs, Data Cleaning, Subqueries.

3. **Case Study #3: Foodie-Fi**
   - Subscription-based food delivery service where the goal is to analyze customer subscriptions, upgrades, and downgrades.
   - Key SQL concepts: Case Statements, Joins, Group By.

*(List continues as more case studies are completed)*

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL was primarily used for writing queries and running analyses.
- **Database Management**: For storing, querying, and managing datasets.

## Structure

- Each case study will have its own folder containing:
  - The problem statement
  - The SQL queries used to solve the problem
  - Insights and analysis based on the queries

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nishieee/8-Week-SQL-Challenge.git
